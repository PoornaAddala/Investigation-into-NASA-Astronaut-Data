# Project Title: Investigation into NASA Astronaut Data

The primary goal of the project, "Investigation into NASA Astronaut Data," was to scrutinize and extract insights from a dataset containing comprehensive information about NASA astronauts. This dataset encompassed details ranging from personal information to educational backgrounds and spaceflight experiences. The core objectives of the project were to meticulously clean and preprocess the dataset, execute data analysis through SQL queries, and visually represent key findings using Tableau.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The initial phase of the project centered on ensuring the dataset's quality and consistency through meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing. Numerous steps were taken, encompassing:

Addressing missing values
Rectifying data types
Eliminating duplicates
Renaming columns
Resolving inconsistencies

## SQL Queries:
The implementation of SQL queries aimed to extract diverse insights, including:

Tallying null values
Filtering astronauts based on various criteria (e.g., birth year, status, missions)
Identifying top astronauts in various categories (e.g., spacewalks, space flights)
Pinpointing astronauts with specific characteristics (e.g., lacking alma mater, no space flights)
Calculating averages and summarizing data
Findings:

## A summary of key findings from the data analysis encompasses insights such as:

Identification of the youngest and oldest active astronauts
Distribution of astronauts' status
Top astronauts based on spacewalks, space flights, etc.
Common undergraduate and graduate majors
Geographical distribution of astronauts' birthplaces

## Data Visualization (Tableau):
Tableau played a pivotal role in crafting visualizations that complemented the SQL-based analysis. This involved detailing:

The purpose behind each visualization
Data sources utilized in Tableau
Selection of appropriate visualization types (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, maps)
Extracted insights from the visualizations
Inclusion of screenshots or embedded visualizations created in Tableau.

## Conclusion:

The project successfully delved into and analyzed NASA astronaut data, uncovering valuable insights into the demographics and experiences of astronauts. It also shed light on challenges related to data quality and completeness. These findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the astronaut community and establish a groundwork for subsequent research and analysis.
